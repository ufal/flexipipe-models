# FLEXIPIPE Models

This repository provides information about available models to use with the flexipipe NLP pipeline. Flexipipe can run NLP pipelines using a number of different backends, including most of the well-established NLP frameworks 
such as SpaCy, UDPIPE, NameTag, HuggingFace, and Stanza. This repository provides two things: a central list of all the official models for those backends where they need one and do not provide one. And on the other hand, additional models
for those backends that were trained using flexipipe.
